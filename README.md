# koa-pg-rest-api (KPRA)

> Scaffolding for an opinionated RESTful API using Koa and PostgreSQL. ðŸ¦´

[Koa](https://koajs.com/) is an alternative to Express.js.

## Usage ðŸ“–

Getting started with this repo...

## Local development

This app relies on [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for local development hot-reloading and debugging.

### Getting started ðŸŒ±

```sh
yarn install
```

#### Database setup ðŸ“¦

As we rely on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), we need to create, migrate and connect to an instance somewhere.

A popular solution is to run an instance via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

```sh
docker run \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=todos \
    -e LANG='en_US.UTF-8' \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -d postgres
```

From here, you can connect using a popular client such as [Postbird](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/postbird) or [pgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) to visualise and interact with the data.

##### Migrations

To create the database tables and seed it with some initial data:

```sh
yarn db
```

#### Hot reloading ðŸ”«

To spin up a local instance of this API:

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Logs out of order

During development, and the way our logging framework [Pino]() works, you'll
see that the log order is out of order. This might seem like an error at first however, it's expected
behaviour due to the way [Pino processes stdout/stderr events](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty/issues/275).
